# Linear-Regression-Machine-Learning
Implementing supervised machine learning modelling, Linear Regression with several types.
The data I used is Housing Prices in Boston City.
I didn't do Data Cleaning because the data is data for training and is already clean.
But I did the process of Linear Regression modelling with modified Loss Function Model that can reduce modelling error, the examples I use are Ridge and Lasso, by looking at the error value using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
And evaluate the results of the modelling using RMSE, MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
## Objective
- The main objective is to discover the best model between Ridge and Lasso Linear Regression.
- Determining the best Lambda for each model
- Evaluating the model

I use raw data which can be accessed at the following link:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pararawendy/dibimbing-materials/main/boston.csv
